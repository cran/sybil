	Abstract = {Genome-scale constraint-based models of several organisms have now been constructed and are being used for model driven research. A key issue that may arise in the use of such models is the existence of alternate optimal solutions wherein the same maximal objective (e.g., growth rate) can be achieved through different flux distributions. Herein, we investigate the effects that alternate optimal solutions may have on the predicted range of flux values calculated using currently practiced linear (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) methods. An efficient LP-based strategy is described to calculate the range of flux variability that can be present in order to achieve optimal as well as suboptimal objective states. Sample results are provided for growth predictions of E. coli using glucose, acetate, and lactate as carbon substrates. These results demonstrate the extent of flux variability to be highly dependent on environmental conditions and network composition. In addition we examined the impact of alternate optima for growth under gene knockout conditions as calculated using QP-based methods. It was observed that calculations using QP-based methods can show significant variation in growth rate if the flux variability among alternate optima is high. The underlying biological significance and general source of such flux variability is further investigated through the identification of redundancies in the network (equivalent reaction sets) that lead to alternate solutions. Collectively, these results illustrate the variability inherent in metabolic flux distributions and the possible implications of this heterogeneity for constraint-based modeling approaches. These methods also provide an efficient and robust method to calculate the range of flux distributions that can be derived from quantitative fermentation data.},

	Abstract = {Reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks is now possible using multiple different data types. Constraint-based modeling is an approach to interrogate capabilities of reconstructed networks by constraining possible cellular behavior through the imposition of physicochemical laws. As a result, a steady-state flux space is defined that contains all possible functional states of the network. Uniform random sampling of the steady-state flux space allows for the unbiased appraisal of its contents. Monte Carlo sampling of the steady-state flux space of the reconstructed human red blood cell metabolic network under simulated physiologic conditions yielded the following key results: 1), probability distributions for the values of individual metabolic fluxes showed a wide variety of shapes that could not have been inferred without computation; 2), pairwise correlation coefficients were calculated between all fluxes, determining the level of independence between the measurement of any two fluxes, and identifying highly correlated reaction sets; and 3), the network-wide effects of the change in one (or a few) variables (i.e., a simulated enzymopathy or fixing a flux range based on measurements) were computed. Mathematical models provide the most compact and informative representation of a hypothesis of how a cell works. Thus, understanding model predictions clearly is vital to driving forward the iterative model-building procedure that is at the heart of systems biology. Taken together, the Monte Carlo sampling procedure provides a broadening of the constraint-based approach by allowing for the unbiased and detailed assessment of the impact of the applied physicochemical constraints on a reconstructed network.},

@article{Segre:2002fk,
	Abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

	Abstract = {The manner in which microorganisms utilize their metabolic processes can be predicted using constraint-based analysis of genome-scale metabolic networks. Herein, we present the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis toolbox, a software package running in the Matlab environment, which allows for quantitative prediction of cellular behavior using a constraint-based approach. Specifically, this software allows predictive computations of both steady-state and dynamic optimal growth behavior, the effects of gene deletions, comprehensive robustness analyses, sampling the range of possible cellular metabolic states and the determination of network modules. Functions enabling these calculations are included in the toolbox, allowing a user to input a genome-scale metabolic model distributed in Systems Biology Markup Language format and perform these calculations with just a few lines of code. The results are predictions of cellular behavior that have been verified as accurate in a growing body of research. After software installation, calculation time is minimal, allowing the user to focus on the interpretation of the computational results.},

@article{Schellenberger:2010fk,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions under the Constraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) framework are valuable tools for analyzing the metabolic capabilities of organisms and interpreting experimental data. As the number of such reconstructions and analysis methods increases, there is a greater need for data uniformity and ease of distribution and use.
DESCRIPTION: We describe BiGG, a knowledgebase of Biochemically, Genetically and Genomically structured genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. BiGG integrates several published genome-scale metabolic networks into one resource with standard nomenclature which allows components to be compared across different organisms. BiGG can be used to browse model content, visualize metabolic pathway maps, and export SBML files of the models for further analysis by external software packages. Users may follow links from BiGG to several external databases to obtain additional information on genes, proteins, reactions, metabolites and citations of interest.
CONCLUSIONS: BiGG addresses a need in the systems biology community to have access to high quality curated metabolic models and reconstructions. It is freely available for academic use at http://bigg.ucsd.edu.},
